Create posts or comments on LinkedIn using the `link-pulse` CLI.

## Create a Post

```
link-pulse post create --text "<post text>"
```

**CONSENT REQUIRED — NEVER SKIP:**
- ALWAYS show the drafted post to the user and wait for explicit approval before publishing.
- Do NOT publish even if the user described the content — always confirm at the moment of posting.
- Only proceed after the user says yes, confirms, or approves. Treat any ambiguity as a no.
- This uses the official LinkedIn API (not browser automation), so it's reliable.
- Keep posts authentic to the user's voice — don't make them sound like AI slop.

## Comment on a Post

```
link-pulse post comment "<post-urn>" --text "<comment text>"
```

The post URN looks like `urn:li:ugcPost:1234567890` or `urn:li:share:1234567890`. You can get it from feed or search results.

**CONSENT REQUIRED — NEVER SKIP:**
- ALWAYS show the drafted comment to the user and explicitly ask "Shall I post this?" before running the command.
- Only proceed after the user confirms.

## Workflow: React to Feed Content

1. Use `/linkedin-feed` to read the feed
2. User picks a post to engage with
3. Draft a thoughtful comment (not generic — reference specific points from the post)
4. Show draft to user and ask "Shall I post this?"
5. Post ONLY after user confirms
